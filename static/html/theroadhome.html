		<p>The Road Home is a program from eBay Motors that honors our veterans as they return home from war.</p>
		<p>eBay Motors partnered with West Coast Customs and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association to give four veterans, one from each branch of the military, with the tricked-out car of their dreams. The car builds, along with the surprise reveals at each of the veterans' homes, aired on an episode of Inside West Coast Customs on Fox Sports.</p>
		<p>The website has information on each of the soldiers and their cars, and also featured a sweepstakes to win a car from West Coast Customs. The sweepstakes were a huge success, with over 50,000 entries received.</p>
